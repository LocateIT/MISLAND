compute SDG 15.3.1 Sub-indicators
----------------------------------
In additin to computing the SDG 15.3.1 indicator, users of the OSS NORTH-AFRICA STATES LDMS can compute and visualize the SDG 15.3.1 sub-indicators i.e Land productivity, Landcover change, and changes in carbon stock as discussed below:

Land Productivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Land productivity is computed form vegetation indices using three measures of change i.e trajectory, state and performace. To compute land productivity on the service  platform, users can follow these simple steps

1. Select SDG 15.3.1 option on the service menu-bar and on the select SDG indicator drop-down below the service menu-bar, choose the 'Productivity' option

Vegetation Loss/Gain indicators
===============================

To compute vegetation loss/gain on the service platform,

1. On the services menu, select the 'VEGETATION GAIN/LOSS' option 

.. figure:: ../_static/Images/vegetation_gain_loss.png

.. note::
   Selection of a smaller regin optimizes the computation time and ensures that the service does not time-out. If a large area is selected, users will be notifed by a pop up on the top right conner of the site. Computation of large ares is still under development and will be available in later versions of the service.

Forest Change
=============
The current release of the OSS NORTH-AFRICA STATES LDMS uses ESA CCI landcover data to compute yearly changes in forest cover using the forest class and the high resolution Hansen Global forest change dataset to quantify forest loss.


To compute the change in forest cover from ESA CCI landcover;

1. On the services menu, select the FOREST CHANGE option as shown below

.. figure:: ../_static/Images/forestchange.png

.. note::
   On the current release of the OSS NORTH-AFRICA STATES LDMS, forest loss from Hansen Global forest change dataset can only be computed for small areas.

To compute forest loss using the Hansen Global forest change dataset;

1. On the top left conner of the Map pannel, click on the 'Draw a Polygon' tool and draw an area on the map where you wish to compute the forest loss
